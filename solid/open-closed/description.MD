Open Closed Principle
=======

_Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification._

## AKA: Open chest surgery is not needed when putting on an extra coat.

We should be able to add new features and components to the application, without breaking the existing code. Breaking changes to existing functionality should not happen. This principle helps to keep code maintenable by minimizing changes needed to working code.
