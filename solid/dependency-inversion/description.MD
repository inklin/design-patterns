Dependency Inversion Principle
=======

_Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. The high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions._

## AKA: Would you solder a lamp directly to the electrical wiring in the wall?

Also called Dependency Injection and Inversion of Controls. This principle is all about handing control from the function itself to the caller of the function.
